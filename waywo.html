          <h2>
            Imagine you are a CEO at a 1000-person company, how would you know
            what people are working on?
          </h2>
          <p class="" id="myText"></p>
          <p>Meetings? Slack DMs? Asking your team?</p>
          <p>
            Sure, that <em>might</em> work. But as teams grow, it becomes a
            massive challenge to understand what people are working on, and if
            they have challenges or blockers that need your attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be a problem across the entire company, but it was much
            bigger for executives because they have to make decisions that
            affect the entire company.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Waywo</em> - an acronym for "what are you working on" solves
            this problem.

            To understand the problem better, I spent a few days listening to
            customer interviews done by the CEO and co-founder. From there, I
            created a product strategy to prioritize features we knew would
            resonate with customers and that people would be willing to pay for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working closely with the AI engineer helped ensure that I fully
            understood the constraints and pushed the possibilities of this new
            technology. Finally, I worked closely with front-end and back-end
            engineers to deliver the MVP on both web and responsive mobile.

            Decisions are often made in tools like Slack, GitHub, or Jira.
            Executives often find out when it's
            <em>too late</em>.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most conversations are done in Slack/Microsoft Teams or meetings,
            but most of it filtered and not seen by execs. And because they’re
            so busy, when things go off-track, they find out too late - often
            weeks later. This leads to decisions being made that end up being
            extremely expensive for the business.

            Some of the early concepts varied from Slack app and email summary
            notifications. With the goal to build a daily a habit product,
            inspiration came from social media to see
            <em>stories</em> of team members and a real-time feed of their
            company.

          <p><em>Early feedback and disagreements</em></p>
          <h2>
            We met in-person for a working session, and the feedback was not
            what I expected...
          </h2>
          <p>
            We discussed strategy, brainstormed ideas, and I started presenting
            some of the concepts I had come up with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I presented three concepts that I was really excited about. The
            first was a Slack app that would send summaries to executives. The
            second was an email summary that would be sent daily or weekly. The
            third was a social app that would have a feed like facebook and
            stories like instagram.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was a moment of silence from the team.. Then Tyler (CEO) said:
          </p>
          <p>Tyler: "I don’t like any of them."</p>
          <p>I wasn't sure why, so I asked for an explanation.</p>
          <p>Me: "Why not?"</p>
          <p>
            Tyler: "It’s not structuring the chaos that leaders have to deal
            with, it's creating more..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Later that day, while driving my colleague Juan (an AI Engineer)
            home, we got into a discussion about large language models like
            Claude 3.5 Sonnet — their limitations, strengths, and how we might
            leverage them. That conversation sparked a new idea.

          <h2>Iterating with a new perspective.</h2>
          <p>
            Driving back home from the team on-site, I had lightbulbs going on
            in my head with ideas.
          </p>
          <p>And an idea came to mind.</p>
          <p>
            What if we visualized the summaries as if someone was giving you a
            written memo in person? I sketched out the idea and shared it with
            the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole team liked this approach. It solved the problem much more
            simply and elegant way. We validated this by testing it with other
            executives who also thought this solved their problem effectively.
          </p>
          <p>We were ready to build our MVP.</p>

          <h2>I worked closely with the engineers to build the MVP.</h2>
          <p>
            During planning and strategy, we knew our MVP would be simple and
            slightly hacky. The team wanted to send summary CSV files to
            customers but I suggested that’s not very user friendly. So we built
            a UI for desktop and mobile.

            Tyler (CEO) sent a video of the moment our first customer was
            signing the deal. These early customers became our design partners,
            offering regular feedback to help evolve the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product evolved at a fast pace — weekly feedback loops allowed
            the team to iterate often. This project provided real potential to
            drive revenue, attract funding, and ultimately, save the company.

            <em>Reflections</em>

          <h2>A lot of learnings...</h2>
          <p>
            These were some of the most exhausting yet rewarding weeks in my
            career. Dealing with the ambiguity of a 0 <em>→</em> 1 product, and
            leveraging AI in a product taught me a lot about how to navigate
            this process.
          </p>
          <p>
            One big takeaway was approaching challenges by solving
            "million-dollar problems" as Tyler (CEO) always advocated to the
            team. Focusing on significant problems that provide tangible value
            is what drives investment and business success.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a delight to work with my team. In hindsight, I should have
            collaborated with AI Engineer even earlier to understand our AI
            constraints because that's what allowed the product to come to life.
