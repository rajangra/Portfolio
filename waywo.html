          <p><em>The Problem</em></p>
          <h2>
            Imagine you are a CEO at a 1000-person company, how would you know
            what people are working on?
          </h2>
          <p class="" id="myText"></p>
          <p>Meetings? Slack DMs? Asking your team?</p>
          <p>
            Sure, that <em>might</em> work. But as teams grow, it becomes a
            massive challenge to understand what people are working on, and if
            they have challenges or blockers that need your attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be a problem across the entire company, but it was much
            bigger for executives because they have to make decisions that
            affect the entire company.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Waywo</em> - an acronym for "what are you working on" solves
            this problem.

          <p>
            To understand the problem better, I spent a few days listening to
            customer interviews done by the CEO and co-founder. From there, I
            created a product strategy to prioritize features we knew would
            resonate with customers and that people would be willing to pay for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working closely with the AI engineer helped ensure that I fully
            understood the constraints and pushed the possibilities of this new
            technology. Finally, I worked closely with front-end and back-end
            engineers to deliver the MVP on both web and responsive mobile.

          </h2>
          <p>
            We brainstormed and discussed ideas, and I presented three concepts
            I was excited about: a Slack app for sending summaries to
            executives, a daily or weekly email summary, and a social app with a
            Facebook-like feed and Instagram-like stories.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was a moment of silence from the team.. Then Tyler (CEO) said:
          </p>
          <p>Tyler: "I don’t like any of them."</p>
          <p>I wasn't sure why, so I asked for an explanation.</p>
          <p>Me: "Why not?"</p>
          <p>
            Tyler: "It’s not structuring the chaos that leaders deal with—it’s
            adding to it..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Later that day, while driving my colleague Juan (AI Engineer) home,
            we discussed large language models like Claude 3.5 and how we might
            leverage them. That conversation sparked a new idea.

          <h2>Iterating with a new perspective.</h2>
          <p>
            On my way back home from the team on-site, I had lightbulbs going
            off in my head with ideas.
          </p>
          <p>And an idea came to mind.</p>
          <p>
            What if we visualized the summaries as if someone were giving you a
            memo in person? I quickly sketched the idea and shared it with the
            team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team loved this approach—it solved the problem more simply and
            elegantly. We validated it with other executives, and they also
            found it effective.
          </p>
          <p>We were ready to build our MVP.</p>

          <h2>We landed our first enterprise customer!</h2>
          <p>
            Tyler (CEO) shared a video of the moment the deal was signed. These
            early customers became design partners, providing valuable feedback
            that helped us evolve the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            With weekly feedback loops, we iterated quickly, and the project
            began to show real potential to drive revenue, and attract further
            funding.

            <em>Reflections</em>
          </p>

          <h2>The process wasn’t easy, but it was incredibly rewarding.</h2>
          <p>
            The ambiguity of building a 0 → 1 product and leveraging AI taught
            me how to navigate complex challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key takeaway was Tyler's focus on solving "million-dollar
            problems" — focusing on issues that provide significant value is
            what drives investment and business success.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a pleasure working with the team. In hindsight, I wish I’d
            collaborated with the AI engineer earlier to understand the
            technology’s constraints, as that’s what brought the product to
            life.
